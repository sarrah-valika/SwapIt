# SwapIt
SwapIt is an innovative mobile platform designed to address challenges faced by university students in acquiring new skills and resources. In todayâ€™s competitive academic and professional environments, students are eager to learn and expand their knowledge but often face financial and accessibility barriers. SwapIt facilitates a peer-to-peer skill-swapping system, allowing students to exchange expertise in areas such as coding, photography, and public speaking. Additionally, the platform enables the barter of essential items like books and electronics, promoting sustainability through resource sharing. By providing a secure, intra-university environment, SwapIt ensures that students feel safe while engaging in skill exchange and item bartering. It is a free, student-driven solution that encourages collaboration and reduces financial pressures. The app incorporates a recommendation system to suggest relevant skills and items based on user profiles and preferences.

Designed with scalability in mind, SwapIt aims to first launch at Habib University before expanding to other institutions. In this way, the platform not only enhances academic and personal growth but also fosters a sustainable, community-oriented culture.
